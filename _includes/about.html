    <p>Currently I have worked with R, Python, and SQL on various school projects which can be found in my repos on my GitHub. 
      The majority of these projects are based around Machine Learning where we have been using Pythons Scikit-Learn library to do the training, validation, and testing. 
      So far I have used the following algorithms for supervised learning: logistic regression, linear regression, deicision trees and random forests.
      I will also be learning this semsester about k-means clustering and nueral networks for unsupervised learning.
      I would say I am not an expert yet at R, Python, and SQL, but I am well on my way to becoming more fluent in scripting 
      in all of these languages. I am also learning other Python based ML libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p>
