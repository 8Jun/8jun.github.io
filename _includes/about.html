    <p>Currently I have worked with R, Python, and SQL on various school projects which can be found in my repos on my GitHub. 
      The majority of these projects are based around Machine Learning and the following algorithms: Linear Regression, 
      Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and K-means clustering using the Python library sci-kit learn. 
      I would say I am not an expert yet using R, Python, and SQL, but am well on my way to becoming more fluent in scripting 
      in all of these languages. I am also learning other Python based Machine Learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p>
